# MC-Simulation-Ensemble-Methods-Heterogeneous-Treatment-Effects
 A fully reproducible Monte Carlo Simulation, assessing the relative efficiency of Ensemble Methods when estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in Selection on Observables settings.
The file "MCS.R" holds the code for the Monte Carlo simulation, "functions.R" a set of custom functions and "MCV.R" the visualization code.
The output underlying the results of the simulation analysed in my paper is saved in the "output"-folder, while graphs and charts are saved in the "graphs"-folder.
